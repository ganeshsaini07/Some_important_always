Que 2.*How JavaScript works?

Ans-Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

Execution context has two component
1)memory component[variable environment] 
-This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

 2)code component[Thread of execution]
-This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

Note-
*JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

-Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
-Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.

       -- setTimeout
       -- Promise 
       -- Loading data from an a Api
       -- Uploading file 
       -- With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in paralell.

       -- why uses aynchronous :- Async programming is vital because it allows multiple processes to run concurrently without interfering with the main thread.
