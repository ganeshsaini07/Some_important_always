 Que 1 . String 
 slice(),substr(),substring() me deffrience
 ANS . https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-string-slice-and-substring-methods#:~:text=Here%2C%20as%20the%20end%20index,%2C%20it%20returns%20'Good'.

 Slice method = > 
  .It returns a part of the string
  .It allows negative indexing and returns string counting from back
  .If start index is greater than the end index, it returns an empty string (5 , 3)

 Substring method => 


Que 2.*How JavaScript works?

Ans-Everything in JavaScript happens inside an "execution context".

Execution context has two component
1)memory component[variable environment] 
-This is the place where all variables and functions are stored as key value pairs. eg-{key: value ||  n:2;} 

 2)code component[Thread of execution]
-This is the place where code is executed one line at a time

Note-
*JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language

-Single threaded means JavaScript can execute once command at a time
-Synchronous single-threaded that means JavaScript can execute one command at a time in a specific order.



que 3. what is uses of event handling in js?  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEQpRTXfxoo)
ans => Event handling to process to responding user actions in web page , like user click to button and want to 
        any changes of webpage this case events helps.
    
Que 4. what is Call back fun?
ans => // call back function => a callback function is function that is passed as an argument/prameter to another 
       function

       addEventListener('click' , function name(){
 
       })

Que 5. Higher oder function?
    => A higher oder functions is take one or more argument function as a argument/parameter        

Que 6. what is ASYNCHRONOUS operation in js?
ans => asunchrounos oprations are operation that do not block the executions of the code 
       setTimeout is asynchronous function which executes call functions after a specific period of time    

       uses of asynchronous oprations in js
       -- setTimeout
       -- Promise 
       -- Loading data from an a Api
       -- Uploading file 
       -- With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in paralell.

       -- why uses aynchronous :- Async programming is vital because it allows multiple processes to run concurrently without interfering with the main thread. 

       -- some operations are taking time to execute in js so we escap to block the code and continue running task in paralell .

       real use of promise in real applications => promise is useful in doing asynchronus oprations and handel the result when result is available in future.

Que 7. what is purpose of "this" in javascript?
Ans => This keyword is represent current context or scope in which code is being excuated.
